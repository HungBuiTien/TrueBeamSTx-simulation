I. Desciption:
    This project perfomed simulation of TrueBeam's head in two cases. 
    Firstly, we simulated a benchmark problem to determine dose profile and depth dose in the water phantom.
    The results were compaired with golden beam data that provided by Varian.
    For the last case, we implemented calculation of EBT3 response in the water phantom.

II. Struct:
    The main folder "TrueBeamSTx-GATE" was divided into various sub-folders that contained some macrofiles for various features.

III. How to run:
    To speed up the simulation, we splited full geometry into two parts.
    The first part aims at obtaining a phase-space (in root format) from original phase-space.
    The simulation in the first part was transported from original phase-space to a phase-space that located at top of water phantom position.
    In the second part, we implemented recycled simulation. The particles were sampled many times to reduce uncertainty.
    
    1. Single-threading run

    To run Gate for single-threading calculation, we only type:
        $ Gate your_mac.mac
    
    example:
        $ Gate mac/S1Main.mac
        $ Gate mac/S2Main.mac

    To visual geometry, let comment 2 lines in main files (using "#" sign) as: 
        #/gate/application/start
        #/gate/application/startDAQCluster
    and uncoment this line as:
        /control/execute                                mac/others/visu.mac

    2. Multi-threading run (using cluster tools)

    Using this line to create submited files:
        $ /home/bthung/Softwares/Gate/source/cluster_tools/jobsplitter/gjs -numberofsplits 10 -clusterplatform condor -condorscript /home/bthung/Softwares/Gate/source/cluster_tools/jobsplitter/script/condor.script mac/S1Main.mac
    
    To run simulation, we simply type:
        $ condor_submit mac/S1Main.submit

    When the simulation finished, let use this command to merge various root files:
        $ hadd myIAEA.root  myIAEA1.root myIAEA2.root myIAEA3.root myIAEA4.root myIAEA5.root myIAEA6.root myIAEA7.root myIAEA8.root myIAEA9.root myIAEA10.root

    To calculte dose in water phantom, we type:
        $ Gate mac/S2Main.mac

    3. Note
    Uncoment one of 2 lines to start acquition of data:
     - The command "/gate/application/start" used for single-threading calculation.
     - The command "/gate/application/startDAQCluster" used for multi-threading calculation.
